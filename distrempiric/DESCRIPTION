Description: Distrempiric is a tool for the analysis of time series.
    The tool includes functions to perform exploratory analysis including graphs that make
    it easier to observe the behavior, trend and seasonality. The user interface facilitates
    the initial parameterization for the load file as well as the definition of the period
    and frequency of the series. Complementary options are included to apply regression according to a trend model of the time series and residual analysis.
